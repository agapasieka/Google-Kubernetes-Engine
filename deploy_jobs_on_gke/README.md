## Overview
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

* Define, deploy and clean up a GKE Job
* Define, deploy and clean up a GKE CronJob

In GKE, a **Job** is a controller that handles one-time tasks that eventually finish. It starts a task (usually in a Pod) and keeps track of it until itâ€™s done. Once the task completes successfully, the Job also finishes. Unlike other controllers that keep things running (like Deployments, which always try to keep a certain number of Pods running), a Job is just about making sure the task gets done once.
A **CronJob** is like a Job, but it runs at specific times or intervals (similar to setting an alarm). For example, you can use a CronJob to perform regular tasks like backups, cleaning up old files, or generating reports. It uses Job objects to do the actual work b

Perform steps in cloud shell or terminal of your choice. 

<!-- Task1 -->
## Set the environment variable for the zone and cluster name
  ```sh
export REGION=
export CLUSTER=
  ```

<!-- Task2 -->
## Create a Kubernetes cluster

  ```sh
  gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER --num-nodes 3 --region $REGION --enable-ip-alias
  ```  

<!-- Task3 -->
## Configure access to your cluster
  ```sh
  gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER --region $REGION
  ```

<!-- Task4 -->
## Create file called example-job.yaml that contains a sample Job that computes the value of Pi to 2,000 places and then prints the result
  ```sh
cat << EOF > example-job.yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  # Unique key of the Job instance
  name: example-job
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: example-job
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl:5.34
        command: ["perl"]
        args: ["-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      # Do not restart containers after they exit
      restartPolicy: Never
EOF
  
  ``` 

<!-- Task5 -->
## Create a Job from this file
  ```sh
kubectl apply -f example-job.yaml
  ```

<!-- Task6 -->
## Check the status of this Job
  ```sh
kubectl describe job example-job  
  ``` 

<!-- Task7 -->
## View all Pod resources in your cluster, including Pods created by the Job which have completed
  ```sh
kubectl get pods
  ```

<!-- Task7 -->
## View all Pod resources in your cluster, including Pods created by the Job which have completed
 ```sh
kubectl get pods  
 ```   

<!-- Task8 -->
## Clean up and delete the Job
  ```sh
kubectl get jobs   
  ```

<!-- Task9 -->
## Retrieve the log file from the Pod that ran the Job
  ```sh
kubectl logs [POD-NAME]   
  ```

<!-- Task10 -->
## Delete the Job
 ```sh
kubectl delete job example-job   
 ```

<!-- Task11 -->
## Define a CronJob manifest called example-cronjob.yaml to deploy a new container every minute that prints the time, date and "Hello, World!".
 ```sh
cat << EOF > example-cronjob.yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hello
            image: busybox
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo "Hello, World!"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
EOF 
  ``` 

<!-- Task12 -->
## Create a Job from this file
 ```sh
kubectl apply -f example-cronjob.yaml
  ```

<!-- Task13 -->
##  Get a list of the Jobs in the cluster
  ```sh
 kubectl get jobs  
  ```

<!-- Task14 -->
##  Check the status of this Job
  ```sh
kubectl describe job [job_name]  
  ```

<!-- Task14 -->
##  View the output of the Job by querying the logs for the Pod
  ```sh
kubectl logs [POD-NAME]
  ```

<!-- Task15 -->
##  Delete all jobs
  ```sh
kubectl delete cronjob hello
  ```

<!-- Task15 -->
## Verify that the jobs were deleted
 ```sh
kubectl get jobs
  ```



## The End
