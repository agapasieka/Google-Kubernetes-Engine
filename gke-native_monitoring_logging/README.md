# Overview

In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:

* Use Kubernetes Engine Monitoring to view cluster and workload metrics
* Use Cloud Monitoring Alerting to receive notifications about the clusterâ€™s health

## Using Kubernetes Engine Monitoring
Google Kubernetes Engine includes managed support for Monitoring.
Create a new cluster with Kubernetes Engine Monitoring support and then perform typical monitoring tasks using the Kubernetes Engine monitoring and logging interface.
